# Getting Started

### INTRODUCTION

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image,in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be an image or characteristics/features associated with that image. 

Antahsagri is an underwater ROV(Remotely Operated Vehicle) which uses camera for underwater exploriation but the output from camera usually get hampered by low contrast, color changes, and interference due, for example,camera noise and floating particles such as sea snow.Especially with cameras mounted on the ROV, these effects make observation more difficult and exhausting.

All this is achived using  OpenCV, Deep Learning, and Python programming language.

### Underwater Object Detection Algorithms

### Meanshift 

The idea behind meanshift is that in meanshift algorithm every instance of the video is checked in the form of pixel distribution in that frame. We define an initial window, generally a square or a circle for which the positions are specified by ourself which identifies the area of maximum pixel distribution and tries to keep track of that area in the video so that when the video is running our tracking window also moves towards the region of maximum pixel distribution.Meanshift is a very useful method to keep track of a particular object inside a video.

### KCF Tracker

KCF is a novel tracking framework that utilizes properties of circulant matrix to enhance the processing speed. This tracking method is an implementation of which is extended to KCF with color-names features.

### Homography

A Homography is a transformation (a 3×3 matrix) that maps the points in one image to the corresponding locations in the other image. In homography, we used a query image, found some feature points in it, took another train image, found the features in that image too, and found the best matches among them.

### Contour Detection and Tracking

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

### Camshift

Camshift or we can say Continuously Adaptive Meanshift is an enhanced version of the meanshift algorithm which provides more accuracy and robustness to the model. With the help of Camshift algorithm, the size of the window keeps updating when the tracking window tries to converge. The tracking is done by using the color information of the object. Also, it provides the best fitting tracking window for object tracking.It then calculates the best fitting ellipse to it and again applies the meanshift with the newly scaled search window and the previous window. This process is continued until the required accuracy is met.

### Color based Object Detection

An object has many global features like color and shape, which describe the purpose as a whole. These features can be utilized to detect an object and track it in a sequence of frames. We will use color as a feature to identify an object with a particular color. This method is useful when an object is of a  specific color, and this color is different from the color of the background. If the object and environment have the same color, then this method for detection will fail.

### Optical Flow

Optical flow is the motion of objects between consecutive frames of sequence, caused by the relative movement between the object and camera.Sparse optical flow selects a sparse feature set of pixels (e.g. interesting features such as edges and corners) to track its velocity vectors (motion). The extracted features are passed in the optical flow function from frame to frame to ensure that the same points are being tracked.

### Canny Edge Detection

Canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments.
